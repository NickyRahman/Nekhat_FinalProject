This file contains all the source code for the Final Project.
27.08.2022 - Research. I will be spending some time and going to through a few sample of games developed using python. 
I have a found a useful website at https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/
The site has many tutorials and options for those who are new to Python and coding.


## DAY 01
### Python Practice
Spent 22 hours practicing **Python coding** at https://www.dataquest.io/path/python-basics-for-data-analysis/
I have found this site to be very useful. The instructions are easy and explain all the basics of Python very clearly.

As I was writing the entries today, I realised my markdown formats were not rendering correctly. Started looking around what could possibly be the issue.
Turns out, when I created the file I did not give it the *.md extension* (the markdown extension). Learning so much from these entries!
